## Hi there 👋

🔭 I work for the [California Digital Library](https://cdlib.org) in Digital Special Collections. I'm currently working primarily on [Rikolti](https://github.com/ucldc/rikolti) - an aggregation system for [Calisphere](https://calisphere.org) - and [Cinco](https://github.com/ucldc/cinco) - a platform for finding aids. 

🌱 I’m currently learning all things Airflow and CloudFormation. With Airflow, I'm particularly interested in different ways to model workflows as DAGs, and the tradeoffs of these different modeling decisions.
